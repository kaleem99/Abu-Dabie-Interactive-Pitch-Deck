Furthermore, each case study explores how the subjects got buy-in for their particular projects from different stakeholders at different levels of the process."

                  "You may already be familiar with the principles of effective management decision making, and have a high level understanding of Machine Learning (ML) as well as the potential benefits this technology could have for your organisation. In this casebook we bring these two topics together to learn how to choose the right machine learning tool for a particular task.",
                  "Recall that the most important aspect when developing a project strategy is to fully understand the problem you are trying to solve. The same goes for ML projects. There is a wide range of ML tools available, each with distinct capabilities and requirements. As such, you must first determine and understand the specific objectives of a project, before considering your options. It’s also necessary to consider what data you have available. While it is always possible to do extra data collection to fit a given purpose, it is often more effective to work with what you have rather than embarking on costly and time consuming data gathering efforts",
                  "Once you have a solid understanding of your problem, your goals, and the resources available, you can start developing your ML strategy. But it is not as simple as just plugging one in and hoping for the best. Since each tool has different data requirements, you have to determine what additional data you may need, and consider how the data, new or old, should be processed for the strategy to be effective. This will inevitably require input from various teams within the business, who may in turn require their own considerations and resources to work effectively.",
                  "All these factors need to be accounted for and included in the project plan alongside a prediction for how the output of this project will be used to inform business decisions. In the next few sections, we will outline three fictional case studies that cover these nuances and interconnected decisions to illustrate how this process works in practice."

                  "A brick and mortar electronics store has recently implemented an online storefront to capture the ever growing base of customers that prefer to do their shopping online, but so far have seen limited growth in sales. They are hoping to increase sales through targeted online advertising and have determined that they will need to identify specific valuable customer segments to get the best return on investment (ROI) for this approach.",
                  "As they have been operating primarily with in store customers until now, they haven’t yet identified these customer segments and want to use ML to automate the process. Fortunately, they already have some customer data through an in store loyalty program as well as customer profiles set up for the online store, but this data is unlabeled and unsorted. For this reason, the manager put in charge of the project has determined that k-means clustering would be the best approach, as it is a specific clustering approach that takes unlabeled data points and groups them into distinct non-overlapping subgroups. This makes it particularly well suited for identifying unique customer segments. The team can then examine these segments to classify those that are most valuable to the business (Sagar, 2019).",
                  "This project will require quantitative data about customer demographics and sales made to these customers that can be pulled from the loyalty program and online store profiles which would require input from the sales, customer support, and analytics teams. The output will help identify customer segments and can be further processed to sort them according to how valuable these segments have been to the business in terms of sales, information that can then be used by the marketing team to shape advertising strategies that target people within this segment and help grow the business."

While they could simply upload scans of the documents to their servers, specific regulations around data privacy and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) require that certain data points be protected in some way, i.e. encryption. The manager charged with finding a way to automate this process knows that the company has already manually digitised a large number of customer data profiles and labelled the individual data points for each. They know that they could use this existing labelled dataset to train a supervised learning algorithm to categorise this labelled data and automatically flag and encrypt any PII included in the filled out forms. This kind of pattern recognition is one of a number of suitable applications for supervised learning through the application of something like a convolutional neural network (CNN) (sixsigma, n.d.).",
                  "While the particularities of designing, training, and implementing the model will be up to the tech team the manager will still need to interface with the legal and data security teams to identify exactly which data points should be identified as sensitive, as well as the teams responsible for data capture up until this point to access the necessary training information and insights into how customer data is captured and input into they system.",
                  "Proper implementation of this strategy will help to simplify operations of the business, saving time and money, while ensuring regulatory compliance and protecting the business from potential legal consequences and reputational damage in case of a data breach."

                  "The manager in charge of this project knows about sentiment analysis, a ML technique for identifying positivity and negativity metrics to text-based data snippets, a very useful tool for identifying user sentiment towards the existing state of a given product or service and even to show which ideas for future changes are most positively received (Dorfman, n.d.)",
                  "A proper implementation of this technology will help with identifying user needs, as well as discovering and planning necessary product improvements. But it will require input and some work from a number of different departments. Firstly the data will need to be gathered from the various sources identified. This could be company-owned sources such as their own private forums, but may also require interfacing with third parties, such as online storefronts or social media platforms to legally scrape relevant text posts relating to the game in question. This data will then also need to be sorted according to topic (responses to the latest map, gameplay changes, or monetization strategies for example), and this will require interfacing with marketing, customer support, social media, legal, and data teams depending on the particularities of the data sources as well as potentially reaching out to the tech team to see whether existing data sorting algorithms could be used to help label the data before textual analysis.",
                  "An effective implementation of this strategy will help with identifying and contextualizing user opinion and identifying potentially desirable improvements to the product, directing business strategy towards enhancing the customer experience and improving products and services."
