The manager charged with finding a way to automate this process knows that the company has already manually digitized a large number of customer data profiles and labeled the individual data points for each. They could use this existing labeled dataset to train a supervised learning algorithm to categorize this labeled data and automatically flag and encrypt any PII included in the filled out forms.
